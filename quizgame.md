This is a simple python game 
a modification of Tech with Tim quiz game project 
WHAT THE PROGRAM WAS DOING BEFORE MODIFICATION
The program was asking user for input if he/she wants to play a game
the program then proceed to ask questions in a chained method and tells 
the user if the answer is correct.
The program then calculates the percentage of score the player has.

MODIFICATIONS MADE

The program can ask the user questions randomly 
The program then calculates the percentage of score 
The program determines if to give a congratulation message or try again letter 
The program should be able to handle other errors such as when user provides a string instead of an intger
The program should give hints and deduct -0.5 for every hint given.
for hint press h 
what if the user has 0.0 points he gets negative -0.5, -1 how will percentage results look like. 

FUTURE MODIFICATIONS(RECOMMENDATIONS)
The program should be implemented to handle zero division errors.
The program should store the user details in a text file(database) 
name and score 

The program should compare the current score of the user with the highest user 
The program should calculate my average score from the txt file
